<h1>The Data Driven Farmer</h1>

<p>A tool for generating reports about Stardew Valley. </p>

<p>At the moment only generates one report: a list of crop profitability, sorted by season and profitability.</p>

<p>This is not terribly user friendly software, sorry. <a href="crop-profit.html">You can the the most recent report I generated in crop-profit.html.</a></p>

<h2>Dependencies</h2>

<p>You'll need a reasonably modern Python 2.</p>

<p>You'll need an unpacked copy of the Stardew Valley data files.  Check out https://imgur.com/gallery/WCfeO for directions on how to do this. You can stop after step 5.  A few updates to that documentation:</p>

<ul>
<li>The best way to find XNB Node is to visit http://community.playstarbound.com/threads/modding-guides-and-general-modding-discussion-redux.109131/ and look for the link under "Tools."</li>
<li>You'll need 7-Zip to unzip the XNB Node archive.  http://www.7-zip.org/download.html</li>
</ul>

<p>Once you've got ContentUnpacked, drop it into the same directory as this program with the name "Unpacked".  Then just run "python data-driven-farmer > crop-profit.html".</p>

<p>Optionally install the font "Scaly Sans", available for free at https://m.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/comments/3vpphx/5e_font_package_embeddable_cc_edition/d1imhc4 </p>
